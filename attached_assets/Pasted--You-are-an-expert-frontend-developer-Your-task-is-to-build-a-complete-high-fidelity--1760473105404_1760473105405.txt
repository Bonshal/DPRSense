## 

You are an expert frontend developer. Your task is to build a complete, high-fidelity, single-page React application that serves as an interactive demo for the **"Intelligent Project Appraisal Platform."**

The application will simulate the results of a complex AI analysis of a Detailed Project Report (DPR). It must be built using **React** and a modern UI library of your choice, like **MUI** or **Tailwind CSS**, to create a **minimalistic, professional, and authoritative user interface**. Focus on creating an intuitive user experience with a clear visual hierarchy.

### **1. Application Flow & Initial Views**

The application must manage these initial states before showing the main dashboard:

- **Login View:** A secure entry point with fields for "Username," "Password," and a "Login" button. **Demo Logic:** Hardcode credentials to `username: admin` and `password: password123`.
- **Upload View:** Appears after login. Must have a clear file upload area and an "Analyze Report" button.
- **Analyzing View:** A brief loading state, a progress wheel (simulate for 5 seconds) showing processing statuses.

---

### **2. Main Dashboard Layout & Navigation**

After the analysis, the application must transition to a dashboard layout featuring a **persistent navigation menu** on the left. This menu will allow the user to switch between different analysis views without scrolling.

The Navbar must contain the following navigation links:

- **Dashboard** (Default View)
- **Compliance & Completeness**
- **Financial Analysis**
- **Risk Assessment**
- **Data Explorer**

### **3. Dashboard Views (Content for Each Navigation Link)**

**A. Dashboard / Overview View**

- This is the landing page after analysis.
- **Required Elements:** Display the most critical, at-a-glance summary cards: the overall **DPR Health Score**, the **Project Title**, Project catergory and the **Total Estimated Cost, Region, estimated duration etc**
    -

    ## ## 1. Contextual & Comparative Analytics (Benchmarking) üìä
    
    **What it is:** A dedicated view or a widget on the main dashboard that benchmarks the current DPR's key metrics against historical averages for similar projects.
    
    **Why it's valuable:** This is a killer feature. It answers the crucial question, "Is this project's cost and timeline reasonable?" A project might be complete and consistent, but still be a bad value. This provides immediate, objective context that is impossible to get from a manual review.
    
    **How it would look:**
    
    - A series of simple bar charts.
    - **Chart 1: Cost Efficiency:** Shows "This Project's Cost" vs. "State Average Cost" for  project in the same category.
    - **Chart 2: Time Efficiency:** Shows "This Project's Duration (Months)" vs. "Average Duration for similar budget size in the category".
    - An alert could be triggered if a metric is significantly above the average (e.g., "> 2 Standard Deviations").
    
    ---
    
    ## ## 2. AI Explainability (XAI) - Risk Factor Breakdown üß†
    
    **What it is:** A small section within the "Risk Assessment" view that explains *why* the AI assigned a particular risk score.
    
    **Why it's valuable:** This builds immense trust. A "High Risk" score is a black box. Showing the contributing factors makes the AI's decision transparent and defensible. The judges will almost certainly ask how you determine risk, and this feature answers that question visually.
    
    **How it would look:**
    
    - A simple, ranked list below the risk gauges.
    - **"High Schedule Delay risk attributed to:"**
        1. **Project Location:** Identified as a landslide-prone zone.
        2. **Stated Risk:** DPR text mentions "dependency on timely forest clearance."
        3. **Benchmark Anomaly:** Project duration is 30% shorter than the average for similar projects.
    
    ---
    
    ## ## 3. Geospatial Visualization (Project Map View) üó∫Ô∏è
    
    **What it is:** An interactive map that displays a pin at the project's geo-coordinates, extracted from the DPR.
    
    **Why it's valuable:** It provides immediate geographical context. For a regional body like MDoNER, understanding *where* a project is located is fundamental. It's also a visually impressive feature that makes the data feel more tangible and real.
    
    **How it would look:**
    
    - A new tab or a large widget on the main dashboard showing a map (using a library like Leaflet or Mapbox), hardcoded for now.
    - A pin marks the project's location.
    - Clicking the pin opens a small popup with the Project Title and Total Cost.
    
    ---
    
    ## ## 4. Action & Collaboration Panel ‚úçÔ∏è
    
    **What it is:** A dedicated panel that allows the official to take the next step in the workflow and leave a record.
    
    **Why it's valuable:** This makes the tool truly useful, not just a viewer. It integrates the AI analysis directly into the bureaucratic process of approval or rejection.
    
    **How it would look:**
    
    - A fixed panel at the bottom or side of the screen.
    - **Action Buttons:** "Approve for Committee Review," "Flag for Clarification," "Reject."
    - **Comment Box:** A text area for the official to add notes (e.g., "The financial mismatch on page 42 needs to be addressed by the implementing agency before this can proceed.").
    - **Audit Trail:** A simple log showing the history of actions taken on this DPR analysis.

**B. Compliance & Completeness View**

- **Required Elements:** A detailed **Completeness Checklist** that shows the status (e.g., "Found" or "Not Found") for all mandatory sections of the DPR.

**C. Financial Analysis View**

- **Required Elements:** An **Inconsistency Report** presented as a table. This table should show the results of logical cross-checks, such as comparing the stated total cost to the sum of all line-item costs.

**D. Risk Assessment View**

- **Required Elements:** Detailed Visual indicators (like gauges or progress bars) for the predicted risks of **Cost Overruns** and **Schedule Delays**, based on the provided data.

**E. Data Explorer View**

- **Required Elements:** A comprehensive, expandable table listing all key data points extracted from the document.
- Each row must show the **Data Point**, its **Extracted Value**, and a way to view its source. This is where the unique PDF viewer feature will be triggered.

---

### **4. Unique Feature: The PDF Source Viewer**

This is a critical feature that must be implemented as described.

just create the UI features for this right now so that the logic behind it can be added later:

- **Trigger:** The user must be able to click a "View Source" icon or button in the **Data Explorer** table.
- **Action:** This must open a modal or popup window.
- **Content:** The modal must display an image of the relevant PDF page with a semi-transparent **highlight box** overlaid on top.
- **Dynamic Positioning:** The position and size of this highlight box must be determined dynamically using the coordinates provided in the `source.highlightBox` object from the hardcoded JSON data.

---

### **5. Data Schema for Hardcoding**

Use the following JSON object as the single source of truth for all data displayed across the different dashboard views.

Plan, create a markdown file with the steps, and execute it step by step

JSON
